# Online Shop
The Online Shop is an eCommerce web application developed using C#. In addition to standard eCommerce functionality, the application includes advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance. This document provides an overview of the project's features and development practices.

## Features
The Online Shop offers the following features:

Product Browsing: Users can browse a wide range of products offered by the online store.

Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart for future purchase.

Checkout: The application allows users to proceed to checkout, review their selected items, and complete the purchase.

User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.

Abandoned Shopping Cart: Logged-in users can view their abandoned shopping carts from previous sessions, making it easy to continue their shopping.

Order History: Users can access their order history to track previous purchases.

## Object-Oriented Programming
The project emphasizes the use of advanced OOP concepts, with a notable focus on inheritance. Inheritance allows for the creation of specialized classes that inherit properties and behaviors from a base class. This design approach promotes code reuse and maintainability.

## Development Workflow
The development workflow for the Online Shop project adheres to best practices and utilizes version control with Git and GitHub.

Atomic Commits: All code changes are committed in atomic commits. Each commit represents a single logical change to the codebase, making it easier to track and manage.

Feature Branches: Development of new features or bug fixes is carried out on separate feature branches. This keeps the main codebase (master branch) stable.

Pull Requests: Once a feature is complete or a bug is fixed, a pull request is created. This allows for code review and collaboration among team members.

Merge to Master: After a successful review, the feature branch is merged into the master branch, ensuring that the new code is thoroughly tested and validated.


By following these practices, the project maintains a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to manage and collaborate with other developers.

The Online Shop project is hosted on GitHub, providing a centralized location for code hosting, collaboration, and issue tracking.

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute to the project, or report any issues through GitHub. Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated!
