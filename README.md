# Online Shop Enhancement

The Online Shop is an eCommerce web application developed using C#. In addition to standard eCommerce functionality, the application includes advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance. This document provides an overview of the project's features and development practices.

## Features

The Online Shop offers the following features:

1. **Product Browsing**: Users can browse a wide range of products offered by the online store.

2. **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart for future purchase.

3. **Checkout**: The application allows users to proceed to checkout, review their selected items, and complete the purchase.

4. **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.

5. **Abandoned Shopping Cart**: Logged-in users can view their abandoned shopping carts from previous sessions, making it easy to continue their shopping.

6. **Order History**: Users can access their order history to track previous purchases.

## Object-Oriented Programming

The project emphasizes the use of advanced OOP concepts, with a notable focus on inheritance. Inheritance allows for the creation of specialized classes that inherit properties and behaviors from a base class. This design approach promotes code reuse and maintainability.

## Development Workflow

The development workflow for the Online Shop project adheres to best practices and utilizes version control with Git and GitHub. Here's an overview:

1. **Atomic Commits**: All code changes are committed in atomic commits. Each commit represents a single logical change to the codebase, making it easier to track and manage.

2. **Feature Branches**: Development of new features or bug fixes is carried out on separate feature branches. This keeps the main codebase (master branch) stable.

3. **Pull Requests**: Once a feature is complete or a bug is fixed, a pull request is created. This allows for code review and collaboration among team members.

4. **Merge to Master**: After a successful review, the feature branch is merged into the master branch, ensuring that the new code is thoroughly tested and validated.

By following these practices, the project maintains a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to manage and collaborate with other developers.

The Online Shop project is hosted on GitHub, providing a centralized location for code hosting, collaboration, and issue tracking.
